Lambda Kernel

*** Description ***

NOTE: For a usable implementation of the kernel, see the lambda-os repository.

Lambda OS is a hobby operating system developed by Peter Farley. Lambda OS
is designed to be portable to multiple systems, and currently supports
x86-based PCs, ARMv7 (Cortex-A9) support is in progress, and RISCV (RV64I)
support is planned.

Platform support:
  - x86
     - PC
  - ARMv7
     - Cortex-A9
        - Versatile Express A9 (early stages)
     - Cortex-A7
        - Allwinner V3s (future plans)
  - RISCV
     - RV64I
        - Kendryte K210 (future plans)

*** Building ***

To be able to build the Lambda kernel, you need the following tools:
  - `gcc` or `clang` (Use cross-compiler if necessary)
  - `make`
  - `eu-readelf` (elfutils)


To build kernel:
  - (If fisrt time) Clone the Lambda OS code repository.
  - (If not first time) Run `git pull`
  - Make: `make`
     - Defaults to x86
     - For clang: `make CC=clang AS=clang`
     - For ARMv7: `make CROSS_COMPILE=<gcc prefix> ARCH=armv7`
     - To speed up compilation, add `-j<threads>` argument to the `make` command
