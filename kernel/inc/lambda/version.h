/*
 * Kernel versioning:
 * 
 * Kernel versions are incremented according to the degree to which changes
 * effect the whole, and not arbitrary milestones:
 * 
 *   Patch: Minor changes have been made. Most if not all software (e.g.
 *          drivers) relying on the kernel's internal functionality should
 *          function as before. All user software only relying on syscalls
 *          should function as before, unless relying on undefined or buggy
 *          behaviour.
 * 
 *   Minor: Moderate-to-significant changes have been made. Software relying
 *          on the kernel's internal functionality is not guaranteed to operate
 *          as before. Changes to syscall interface are possible, and some
 *          software/libraries may need to be recompiled against the new kernel.
 * 
 *   Major: Significant changes have been made to the kernel. No software is
 *          guaranteed to remain functional.
 * 
 * When a higher version position is increased, all lower version positions are
 * reset to zero.
 * 
 * When a lower version position reaches 255, the next version will result in the
 * higher version incrementing regardless of the degree of the changes.
