Creating Lambda OS modules

*** Intro ***

This document will help you get started with creating a very basic module. This will provide you with some sample code and explain all of it to you.

*** Structure ***

Lambda kernel modules are in the form of non-executable ELF binaries. The data
necessary to load them is kept in a special ELF section, `lamnda_mod_data`. The
format of the main data structure found at the beginning of this structure can
found in `mod/module.h::mod_head_t`.

All pointers to metadata must be in the same `lambda_mod_data` section.
Pointers to functions and other data can be in any section.



*** Example Code ***

#include <lambda/mod.h> // DRIVER_*
#include <lambda/msg.h> // kmsg

/* TODO */
